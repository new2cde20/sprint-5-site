This is my Azure Landing Page application.\
It is Question 2 of Lab 2 for sprint 2 in software engineering, CPSC 44000.\
It contains an HTML and CSS file, along with a README and LICENSE file.\
All content in this page is original.\
In order to run this application, you will have to clone\
my github repository into a folder on your laptop,\
which will give you all the files needed (HTML and CSS)\
to run this application. After that, you will be able\
to click on the HTML file (index.html) and it will\
display the Landing Page in your default browser.
