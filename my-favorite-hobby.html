            <p> <li>My favorite hobby is traveling. My first time traveling was when I went to the Philippines in December 2017.
            I went for several days as part of a Mission trip with several other people. I've always been interested in traveling so 
            when I got the chance to go to the Philippines, I was estatic. I was a student at Benedictine University at the time. 
            Those 10 days there were life-changing and I have been craving travel ever since.</li> <p></p>

            <li>I traveled abroad again in March of 2019 to the state of Piau√≠ in Brazil. This was part of a class trip at Lewis 
                University. I was grateful for the experience and wanted to travel again.</li> <p></p> 
        
            <li>I found another opportunity to travel through an email I received from an organization called the Tandana Foundation. 
            I was supposed to go to Ecuador with them for a health care venture. You can read a general overview about their health care venture trip 
            here: <a href="http://www.tandanafoundation.org/health_care_volunteer_venture.html" target="_blank">Tandana Foundation Health Care Venture.</a> 
            They also have other links within this page with more information about their program. These include: <br></br>
            <table style="width:75%">
                    <tr>

                        <td>Financial Assistance</td>

                    <tr>                    
                        <td>Registration Information</td>
                        <td><p><a href="https://tandanafoundation.org/registration_information.html" class="registration_information" target="_blank">Registration Information</a></p></td>                    
                    </tr>
            </table>        
            <div class = second_to_last_paragraph>
                I was supposed to travel with them last year, but my trip got delayed due to a national state of emergency that was declared 
                over there. Then, this year, everything got canceled because of the Coronavirus. My hope is to be able to go to Ecuador 
                once the pandemic gets better.</li> <p></p>
            </div>

            <div class = last_paragraph>I'd say to anyone interested in traveling to definitely do it! It's a once in a lifetime experience and definitely changes
            you and your perspective on life. I got involved with traveling through my school so if you're a student at any level,
            definitely check out any programs that your school may have. They often can help with financial aid if that's a concern.
            There are also multiple programs outside of academic settings, so if you're not a student, you can still travel! If you
            Google "traveling programs" you'll find a plethora of information online. There are also traveling fairs you can attend -
            I attended one in high school and found a lot of programs that way. Often, these programs, whether you find them online or 
            at in-person events, offer financial assistance and payment plans if money is a concern. They often also have a list of
            information with answers to frequently asked questions and concerns.</div>
